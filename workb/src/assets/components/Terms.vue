Users of the Science version will not have any right to economic compensation.</p>
      <p>7.6 WorkBoost shall never be liable for faults caused by any of the reasons stated in the provisions Maintenance and Downtime, Limitation of Liability and Force Majeure, faults caused by changes to or interference with the Application made by the User, or other circumstances for which the User or a third party is liable or that are in some other way beyond WorkBoost's control.</p>

      <p>8.1 After 25 May 2018 Personal Data is regulated by GDPR (Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data). WorkBoost will maintain a level of security for the Services in accordance with the now mentioned rules.</p>
      <p>8.2 When it comes to Manager Personal Data, WorkBoost is seen as the Processor and the Manager, or when applicable, the Customer, as the Controller.</p>
      <p>8.3 When it comes to User Personal Data the Manager, or when applicable, the Customer, is seen as Controller and solely responsible for the collection, storing and management of such potential personal data. WorkBoost, as a Processor, will only store such data and use certain data from Science versions of the Application in an anonymized format without the possibility to identify separate individuals.</p>
      <p>8.4 The User is responsible for ensuring that the processing of data within the Application takes place in accordance with applicable legislation and in accordance with these Terms.

      <p>8.5 In the event of any loss or damage to User Data, WorkBoost will use all reasonable commercial efforts to restore the lost or damaged User Data from the latest back-ups that are maintained by WorkBoost.

      <p>8.6 WorkBoost undertakes to only process personal data in accordance with the Terms and the written instructions of the Manager or the Customer. WorkBoost shall carry out the technical organizational measures that have been agreed upon.

WorkBoost will never share email addresses with other third parties than the now mentioned.</p>
